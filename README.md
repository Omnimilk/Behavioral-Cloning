# Behavioral-Cloning
Udacity Self-Driving car nano degree project 3

# Project Structure
My project includes the following files:
* model.py containing the script to create and train the model
* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode
* nvidiaModel.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network 
* writeup_report.md or writeup_report.pdf summarizing the results

Using the Udacity provided simulator and drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing 
```sh
python drive.py nvidiaModel.h5
```

# Simulation environment and training data
Provided by Udacity.

# Objective
The objective is essentially to train a regression neural network that takes an image as input and generate a steering angle as output.
